# K3s Dev Container

## Introduction

A "dev container" is a Docker container specifically configured to act as a fully functional development environment, allowing developers to work on a project with all necessary tools, dependencies, and settings pre-installed, regardless of their local machine setup, ensuring consistency across different environments and team members; essentially, it packages a complete development environment into a containerized format. 

K3s is a lightweight, open-source version of Kubernetes that's designed for resource-constrained environments. It's a certified distribution that's fully compatible with Kubernetes.
